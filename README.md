PROJECT OVERVIEW

I built this project to apply my data analysis skills in a real, end-to-end workflow. The focus was on taking a raw dataset, cleaning and structuring it properly, analyzing it using SQL, and finally turning the results into clear visual insights through a dashboard and presentation.

DATASET SUMMARY

The dataset contains customer and transactional information covering demographics, purchasing behavior, and product details. It includes attributes related to customers, purchases, ratings, discounts, and other behavioral indicators that allow exploration of trends, preferences, and revenue patterns.

DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION IN PYTHON

I used Python in VS Code to clean and prepare the dataset before analysis. This involved loading the data, handling missing values, standardizing column names, and creating new features to support deeper analysis. I also checked for inconsistencies and removed unnecessary or redundant fields to ensure the data was accurate and analysis-ready.

DATABASE & SQL ANALYSIS

After cleaning, the dataset was loaded into a PostgreSQL database. I wrote SQL queries to explore key patterns such as customer behavior, spending trends, product performance, and demographic differences. Using SQL allowed me to structure the analysis efficiently and extract insights that could be easily reused and visualized.

DATA VISUALIZATION IN POWER BI

The PostgreSQL database was connected to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard presents key metrics, trends, and comparisons in a visual format, making the insights easy to understand and explore. Filters and visuals allow users to analyze the data from different perspectives and identify patterns quickly.

REPORTING & PRESENTATION

To communicate the findings clearly, I documented the analysis in a report and created a presentation using Gamma. The presentation focuses on summarizing insights, highlighting trends, and explaining the impact of the analysis in a simple and visual way.

KEY LEARNINGS
This project helped me strengthen my skills across data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, database integration, and data visualization. It reflects how I approach data projects methodically, with a focus on turning raw data into meaningful insights that can support decision-making.
